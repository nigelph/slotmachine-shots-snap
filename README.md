My first ever university project using Java to learn Object Oriented Programming and create three games within the terminal.

## Slot Machine
Terminal based slot machine where you can spin the machine, insert tokens, lose/gain tokens, leave or try again.

## Shots
Terminal based game between two players deciding which player has to take a shot.

## Snap
A terminal based game between two players playing a traditional snap game
